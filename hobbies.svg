                    There is a <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1798-you-are-the-average-of-the-five-people-you-spend" target="_blank">saying</a>: you are the average of the five people you spend the most time with. Well, when it comes to hobbies, this can be translated to:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <blockquote>
                        Your hobbies correspond to the five <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit#Subreddits" target="_blank">subreddits</a> you frequent the most.

                    <p>
                        That being said, I spend a lot of my free time tinkering with my homelab, 3D-printing (and 3D-cleaning-up), building and clacking mechanical keyboards, ricing my linux machines in accordance to the latest trends in unixporn, and letting the magic smoke out in my experiments with electronics.

                    <p>
                        How many keyboards does a person really need? The number you're thinking right now is really an order of magnitude lower than it should be. Once you *clack*, you can never go back.
