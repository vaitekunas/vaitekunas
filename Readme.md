### ‚ú® About me

Hi, I'm Mindaugas, aka *mindow*. I'm a Full Stack Data Scientist,
with 10+ years of experience using
predictive analytics, data engineering and software development
to do all kinds of *funky* stuff. I enjoy building things all the way
from an abstract idea, to something you can touch
(inasmuch as you can touch digital products).

Currently working as a senior data scientist at a consulting firm in [Nuremberg, Germany](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Nuremberg/).

### üõ†Ô∏è Tech stack

As a Data Scientist, I primarily work with `Python` and `SQL`. For projects that require a reactive frontend, [like in this one](https://github.com/vaitekunas/reviewer), I use `Vue.js`. When I'm building less *data-sciency* applications, I often turn to `Java`. And for side projects, I usually reach for `Rust`.

### üåü Hobbies

<div class="container">  
    <p>
        There is a <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1798-you-are-the-average-of-the-five-people-you-spend" target="_blank">saying</a>: you are the average of the five people you spend the most time with. Well, when it comes to hobbies, this can be translated to:
    </p>
    <p>
        <blockquote>
            Your hobbies correspond to the five <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit#Subreddits" target="_blank">subreddits</a> you frequent the most.
        </blockquote>

        <img alt="My homelab" src="assets/homelab.jpg" class="float-image" height="400"/>
        <p>
            That being said, I spend a lot of my free time tinkering with my homelab, 3D-printing (and 3D-cleaning-up), building and clacking mechanical keyboards, ricing my linux machines in accordance to the latest trends in unixporn, and letting the magic smoke out in my experiments with electronics.
        </p>            
        <img alt="My split ergonomic keyboards" src="assets/keebs.jpg" class="float-image right" width="300"/>
        <p>
            How many keyboards does a person really need? The number you're thinking right now is really an order of magnitude lower than it should be. Once you *clack*, you can never go back.
